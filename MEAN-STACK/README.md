# MEAN Stack RESTful API
<h2> Contact List App</h2>

This repo contains the code for a RESTful API Contact List App  built using the MEAN stack:

<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

Install the Node modules with

    npm install

then make sure MongoDB is running with

    mongod

from your MongoDB directory, and then run the code with 

    node server

More CRUDE Methods are enabled from @server.js to serve application once disc data is migrated to MongoDB.
The buttons attached to the UI to execute added extended CRUD response/request methods will work once the MongoDB database is added to the application. 
Provision for this has been made in the @server.js sequence algorithm. The data for this instance is being loaded from the disc via the server.
