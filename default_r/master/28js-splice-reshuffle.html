<p>In this example there is reshuffling. Orange moves to the first position, and Banana to the last. Note when you positioning or adding  an element as last item in the array. The elements in between to the added or reshuffled ones are removed. If the added elements are placed following each other then subsequent items in the array will be shown. Again if the added element is positioned as last, the elements in between the positioned elements will not be shown. </p>
