<!-- Adding Properties to a Prototype
You cannot add a new property to a prototype the same way as you add a new property to an existing object, because the prototype is not an existing object.
To add a new property to a constructor, you must add it to the constructor function: -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
function person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eye;
    this.nationality = "English";//note
}

var myFather = new person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
var myMother = new person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"My father is " + myFather.nationality + ". My mother is " + myMother.nationality + " to."; 
</script>
</body>
</html>
