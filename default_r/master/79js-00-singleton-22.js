/*
They're often an indication that modules in a 
system are either tightly coupled or that logic is overly
 spread across multiple parts of a codebase. 
 Singletons can be more difficult to test due to issues ranging 
 from hidden dependencies, 
 the difficulty in creating multiple instances, difficulty in 
 stubbing dependencies and so on.

 The Singleton pattern is thus known because it restricts instantiation of a class
  to a single object. Classically, the Singleton pattern can be implemented by creating a 
  class with a method that creates a new instance of the class if one doesn't exist. 
  In the event of an instance already existing, it simply returns a reference to that object.

Singletons differ from static classes (or objects) as we can delay their initialization,
 generally because they require some information that may not be available during initialization 
 time. They don't provide a way for code that is unaware of a previous reference to them to easily retrieve them. This is because it is neither the object or "class" that's returned by a Singleton, it's a structure. Think of how closured variables aren't actually closures - the function scope that provides the closure is the closure.

In JavaScript, Singletons serve as a shared resource namespace which isolate 
implementation code from the global namespace so as to provide a single point of access for 
functions.

We can implement a Singleton as follows:

*/


var mySingleton = (function () {
 
  // Instance stores a reference to the Singleton
  var instance;
 
  function init() {
 
    // Singleton
 
    // Private methods and variables
    function privateMethod(){
        console.log( "I am private" );
    }
 
    var privateVariable = "Im also private";
 
    var privateRandomNumber = Math.random();
 
    return {
 
      // Public methods and variables
      publicMethod: function () {
        console.log( "The public can see me!" );
      },
 
      publicProperty: "I am also public",
 
      getRandomNumber: function() {
        return privateRandomNumber;
      }
 
    };
 
  };
 
  return {
 
    // Get the Singleton instance if one exists
    // or create one if it doesn't
    getInstance: function () {
 
      if ( !instance ) {
        instance = init();
      }
 
      return instance;
    }
 
  };
 
})();



//Bad Singleton
 
var myBadSingleton = (function () {
 
  // Instance stores a reference to the Singleton
  var instance;
 
  function init() {
 
    // Singleton
 
    var privateRandomNumber = Math.random();
 
    return {
 
      getRandomNumber: function() {
        return privateRandomNumber;
      }
 
    };
 
  };
 
  return {
 
    // Always create a new Singleton instance
    getInstance: function () {
 
      instance = init();
 
      return instance;
    }
 
  };
 
})();
 
 
// Usage:
 
var singleA = mySingleton.getInstance();
var singleB = mySingleton.getInstance();
console.log( singleA.getRandomNumber() === singleB.getRandomNumber() ); // true
 
var badSingleA = myBadSingleton.getInstance();
var badSingleB = myBadSingleton.getInstance();
console.log( badSingleA.getRandomNumber() !== badSingleB.getRandomNumber() ); // true
 
// Note: as we are working with random numbers, there is a
// mathematical possibility both numbers will be the same,
// however unlikely. The above example should otherwise still
// be valid.
